# CSFD Tools
Tool to conduct crater size-frequency measurements from polygon shapefiles.
Currently in beta version.

The compiled version of this tool can be downloaded here:

A detailled documentation will be added soon.

# Requirements

The tool uses the following external libraries: 

GDAL and Shapely for geospatial applications and map projections  
PyQT4, Matplotlib Basemap, and descartes for the user interface layout  
Numpy for array management  

All libraries are included in the compiled version of CSFD Tools. No further software is required.  
The compiled version was tested on Windows 7.
